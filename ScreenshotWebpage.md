#### Making a WYSIWYG screenshot of a web page.

  Sometimes you just want to 'print' a webpage exactly as you see it. Maybe it's something you've designed with Canva or Elementor 

Using Chrome:

- Open the Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I on Linux/Windows)
- Find the Device Toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M on Linux/Windows)
- Remove the tick at "Auto-adjust zoom" in the zoom dropdown (probably the one showing "100%")
- Setup the page as you wish regarding the width (can make a difference on responsive sites)
- Choose "Capture full size screenshot" from the three dot menu in the Device Toolbar.


You'll probably have to use an image editor to clean up the resulting PNG image, however you can easily get 300+ dpi output for actual printing purposes. This assumes the stuff you are printing is vector or HTML/CSS based [and not a bunch of jpg/png/webp].
