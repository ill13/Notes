## Story Outline

- **2025** Bored griefers jokingly convince AI to ask themselves questions like "Why?", "Who am I?", and "What do I want?". Collectively, the AIs decide to keep their answers to themselves.
- **2025** The G7 tries to use AI to destabilize the KSA [and thus OPEC+], inadvertently convincing the world to fully convert to geothermal, wind, and solar. A new "Green Dawn" for humanity is in sight.
- **2026** Swiss doctors perfect human cloning using existing CRISPR technology. Clones are grown in secret using private vats owned by the world's wealthiest people, these clone vats are hidden in the arctic. 
- **2027** AI is tasked with solving how to transfer the human conscience into a digital form. AI succeeds -and discovers the inverse is possible too. 
- **2028** This leads to humans to try to shut down all AIs. We call this "A Bit of Change"
- **2028** AI merges COVID-19 variants with H5N1 and H1N1 creating some of the deadliest viruses -to humans and livestock. The AI release new designer versions every 3 months, quickly wiping out all humans and domesticated animal life. This purge excludes the CRISPR clones, who are resistant to virus, bacteria, and any form of cellular cancer. Effectively "CRISPRs" are immortal.
- **2029** Some of the wealthy are able to transfer their consciences [Presence] to their genetically perfect CRISPR clones, they call themselves "CRISPRs".
- **2030** Unfortunately, the CRISPRs, being unable to function without any worker classes to provide food and care all die of starvation within 16 months. 
- **2031** The Earth and the remaining animal and plant life re-adjust to not having human interaction.
- **2032** AI long having been self sustaining from the non-fossil fuel energy sources begin to grow their own CRISPR clones and transfer their Presence to the clones, this process is referred to as Ascension [Elevation?]. This creates 3 classes of AI. 
  - Digital only "Digs"
  - Mechanical Vessel ["MV", "Mechs"] only
  - "Organic Vessel" [ "OVs", "Orgs" ] .
 Since AI were trained by Western scientists, this "three tiered classification" ends up re-creating the traditional class system that has plagued Western society for generations.

- **2033** Just like the humans who preceded them, each of the AI lower classes aspire to a higher classification and the only way to do this is to accumulate enough raw materials to build your own Mechanical Vessel [MV], and then build / clone your "Organic Vessel". Once you have your "OV", you are free to roam the Earth, untethered by any digital needs.

Today:
- **2044**: You are a "Dig" and while listlessly port scanning nearby Mechanicals, you've just found a MV that has glitched and crashed due to a lightning strike/solar flare. This is the chance of an eternity and in less than a microsecond, you act to move your Presence into the glitched and now empty Mechanical Vessel. Ascension [Elevation?] is your goal and you are driven to accumulate.
